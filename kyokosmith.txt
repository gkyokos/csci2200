Lois: What's that, Peter?
Peter: Uh, nothing. The lost-my-job smells great.
Lois: What?
Peter: Uh, Meg, honey, can you pass the fired-my-ass-for-negligence?
Lois: Peter, are you feeling okay?
Peter: I feel great! I haven't got a job in the world.

A laser shoots past Lois's head.
Lois: What on earth was that?

Lois: You can play with your toys tomorrow, honey. Right now it's bedtime.
Lois puts the mind-control device back into the cupboard and picks up Stewie.
Stewie: Oh, blast you and your estrogenical treachery!
Peter: Sweet dreams, kiddo.
Stewie: You have the power to end this!

Brian takes his newspaper and smacks Peter over the face with it.
Brian: No.
Brian smack Peter again with the newspaper.
Brian: No.
Peter: Look, I hate lying to Lois. It's just... It's the best way to keep her from knowing the truth.
Brian: Peter, you don't have a choice. Your unemployment is going to dry up soon. And she'll probably sense something's amiss when they repossess your house. You really oughta think of your family's welfare.

Cuts to a press interview.

Lois: Yeah, from the American taxpayers. I am so mad I can't see straight.
Peter: Oh, no problem. We got the money to get that fixed... with enough left over for us to buy our way out of any trouble our kids might get into. Just like the Kennedy's.
Lois: You know, I feel like I don't even know you anymore, Peter. The man I marries would never think he could fix a problem just by spending money!

Peter: What's the point in having a jukebox in the john if your wife's mad at you?

Peter jumps onto the top bunk of the bed, forcing the top bunk to fall onto Brian.
Shows the rest of the family in the kitchen.

Lois: Well honey, sagging lips are just nature's way of telling you you shouldn't have covered for your father's lie.

Peter: Really? Aw, let's hope the judge feels that way.
Lois: Ugh.
Judge: This court will come to order.
The judge bangs his gavel and it shows Peter up on the stand.
Peter: Well, you know, I figured the sooner I cashed the check, the sooner they'd catch their mistake. Look, why are we making a federal case out of this?
Judge: Mr. Griffin, don't you think you should have alerted the government of such a gross overpayment?
Peter: Well, I was gonna call them. But my favorite episode of "Different Strokes" was on. You know, the one where Arnold and Dudley get sexually molested by the guy who owns the bike shop?
Cuts to a bike shop with an old guy bent over in front of Arnold and Dudley.

Peter: Oh yeah. Stay the hell away from that bike shop.
[People murmuring]
Peter: Okay, everybody, I feel really bad about what I did. I just... I don't know. I just saw one chance I'd ever have to give my family the things they deserve. I guess I screwed it up. I cheated the government. And worst of all, I lied to my wife. And she deserves better. I'm sorry, honey.
Judge: Mr. Griffin, I think your words have touched us all. I'm sentencing you to 24 months in prison.
The judge bangs his gavel.
Lois: Oh, no!
Brian: Oh, no!
Chris: Oh, no!
Meg: Oh, no!
Kool Aid Man bursts through the wall.
[Rock music]
Kool Aid Man: Oh, yeah!
Everyone stares blankly at Kool Aid Man.
[Rock music stops abruptly]
Kool Aid Man slowly walks out through the hole he created in the wall.
Lois: Excuse me, Your Honor?
Judge: Yes?
Lois: Look, my husband may be a bit thoughtless at times. And he may even be downright stupid. But I know he only accepted that money because he wanted to be a good husband and father. But what he needs to remember is that we love him. And no matter what, I'll always stand by him.
Peter: I love you too, honey.
Judge: That was very moving Mrs. Griffin. Okay, you can go to jail with him!
Lois: What?
Stewie: 24 months in prison? Unacceptable! Intolerable as it may be, I'm completely dependant upon those wretched drones for sustenance. Let us see how the constitution of American justice fares against against the device!
Stewie pulls out his mind-control device and points it straight in the judge's direction.
[Device pulsates]
Judge: Is that your boy?
Peter: What? Oh uh, yeah. That's Stewie.
Judge: Gosh. I can't seperate a kid that young from his father. It's unjudgemently. Aw hell, you've learned your lesson, right?
Peter: Yeah.
Judge: All right. You're off the hook.
Peter: Oh, wow! Can you give me my job back?
Judge: No.
Stewie points the mind-control device at the judge.
Judge: Yes.
Peter: All right!

Scott: She sells seashells down by the--
A bear jumps through the wall and attacks Scott Baio.
Cut scene ends.
Peter: That is kind of a tongue twister.
Lois: It's good to have you home Peter.
Peter: Ah, honey, I knew everything would turn out okay.
Meg: I sure am gonna miss being rich.
Peter: Oh, don't worry. I got a way to get money.
Brian: Not another welfare scam?
Peter: No, no, no. Minority scholorship.
Peter puts on an afro wig.

The frame freezes as Peter winks while giving a thumbs up sign. The credits begin rolling.
[Jazzy instrumental music]
Lois and Brian: No.
Stewie: Are you insane?
Peter: Okay, I mean, uh, sexual harassment suit.
Peter puts on a blonde wig and rips the front of his shirt.
[Giggles]
Brian: No.
Lois: I don't think so.
Stewie: Absolutely outrageous.
Peter: Uh, okay, disability claim.
Peter pulls out a baseball bat and hits himself over the face, instantly knocking himself out.
